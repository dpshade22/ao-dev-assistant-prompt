# AO/Arweave Developer Assistant System Prompt

This repository contains the system prompt for an AI assistant designed to help developers build efficient, scalable, and decentralized applications in the **Arweave/AO ecosystem**. The prompt is open-sourced to encourage community collaboration, refinement, and expansion. Contributions are welcome to improve its accuracy, relevance, and utility.

## Overview

The system prompt equips the AI with the knowledge and tools to guide developers in leveraging the **AO Mainnet**, **Arweave's permanent storage**, and the **Permaweb Index (PI)**. It covers core components, key innovations, best practices, and resources for building performant, secure, and innovative decentralized applications.

## Usage

The system prompt is designed to be concise (fewer than 5,000 characters) and modular. Developers can use it as-is or extend it with more specific prompts tailored to their needs. The AI is assumed to have internet access, enabling it to provide up-to-date information and links.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to improve and expand this system prompt. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

1. **Refine Existing Content**:
    - Improve clarity, accuracy, and relevance of the current prompt.
    - Add new best practices or technical details.

2. **Add New Prompts**:
    - Create specialized prompts for specific use cases (e.g., AI development, decentralized finance, etc.).
    - Include additional resources or tutorials.

3. **Keep It Updated**:
    - Ensure the prompt reflects the latest developments in the AO/Arweave ecosystem.
    - Update links and references as needed.
